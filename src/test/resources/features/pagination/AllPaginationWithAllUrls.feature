  @smoke
  Scenario Outline: SRP. Check pagination and vehicle details for each site
    Given I go to Search Result Page by "<baseUrl>" url
    When I open first Vehicle Details Page
     Then Status code of VehicleDetailsPage should be "200"
     And There should not be error message "Unfortunately, we couldnâ€™t find this page" on VehicleDetailsPage
    When I go back to the previous page
    Then Search Result Page is open
    And All pagination items should open on Search Result Page

    Examples:
      | baseUrl                                                                              |
